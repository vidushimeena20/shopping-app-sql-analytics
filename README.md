## About This Project
This project is based on an online shopping application.  
I created this database and analysis system to understand how customers purchase products and how sales perform over time.

The main idea behind this project is to use SQL to generate useful business insights from raw data.

## What I Did
In this project, I:

- Designed a relational database using multiple tables
- Inserted sample customer, order, and payment data
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze sales and customer behavior
- Created advanced queries using window functions and CTEs
- Calculated important business KPIs
- Organized the complete project on GitHub

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- SQL
- GitHub

## Database Tables
The project contains the following tables:

- Customers  
- Categories  
- Products

## Project Structure
All SQL scripts are stored in the `sql` folder.  
Documentation and reports are in the `docs` folder.  
Query output screenshots are stored in the `screenshots` folder.

## Key Learnings
Through this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Writing complex SQL queries
- Using joins, subqueries, and window functions
- Analyzing business data
- Structuring a real-world analytics project
